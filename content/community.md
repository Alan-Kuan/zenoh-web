# Communication

The Zenoh community is most readily found on
[its Discord server](https://discord.gg/cRFZDJfS3g), where you're welcome to
ask questions, report problems, or pitch ideas.

# Issues

GitHub is used for tracking issues.  
If your issue is related to the Zenoh protocol, the infrastructure or the REST API, the primary location is https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/issues.  
If your issue is related to an API, please use the GitHub issues related to the API:
  *  [Python API](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-python/issues)
  *  [C API](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-c/issues)

If your issue is instead related to a plugin, please use the GitHub issues related to the plugin:
  *  [DDS plugin](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-dds/issues)
  *  [Webserver plugin](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-webserver/issues)
  *  [InfluxDB backend](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-backend-influxdb/issues)

If you want to propose new features, feel free to start a discussion on the 
  * [Zenoh's discussion board](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap/discussions)

If you're a Zenoh user, you're highly encouraged to keep an eye on the issues in specific repositories
and jump in on the [discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap/discussions), to help us understand how design tradeoffs might
affect you.

These repositories also contain milestones for upcoming *major* releases, which
are currently used to track breaking changes that might be considered for the
next major release.
