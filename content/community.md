# Communication

The zenoh community is most readily found on
[its gitter channel](https://gitter.im/atolab/zenoh), where you're welcome to
ask questions, report problems, or pitch ideas.

# Issues

Github is used for tracking issues.  
If your issue is related to the zenoh protocol, the infrastructure or the REST API, the primary location is https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/issues.  
If your issue is related to an API, please use the Github issues related to this API:
  *  [Python API](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-python/issues)
  *  [Java API](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-java/issues)
  *  [Go API](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-go/issues)

If you're a zenoh user, you're highly encouraged to keep an eye on these issues
and jump in on the discussions, to help us understand how design tradeoffs might
affect you.

These repositories also contain milestones for upcoming *major* releases, which
are currently used to track breaking changes that might be considered for the
next major release.
